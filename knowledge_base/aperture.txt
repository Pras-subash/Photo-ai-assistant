Aperture is a fundamental concept in photography that controls the amount of light entering the camera lens and affects the depth of field. It's measured in f-numbers (f-stops). A lower f-number (e.g., f/2.8) means a wider aperture, letting in more light and creating a shallow depth of field (blurry background). A higher f-number (e.g., f/16) means a narrower aperture, letting in less light and resulting in a larger depth of field (more of the scene in focus).

Wide apertures are commonly used for portraits to isolate the subject, while narrow apertures are preferred for landscapes to ensure everything from foreground to background is sharp.
